# ImpactOfCOVID19SchoolClosuresOnMTARidership
This is a brief project assessing the impact of sudden COVID-related school closures and openings on MTA ridership in NYC.

Data sources: MTA turnstile data, timeline of public declarations and restrictions in NY State and NYC from Jan 2020 - April 2021.

Short answer: Sudden school closures and openings did not have a detectable impact on MTA ridership. 
Folks from NYC might not be surprised by this result, but I was!

Implications: This sort of analysis (using sudden closures/openings due to COVID19-related restrictions) may be useful
to municipalities in understanding their operations. Future planning of maintenance, staffing, and renovations could 
be informed by case studies like this.
